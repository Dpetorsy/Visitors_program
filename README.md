## üìú About Project

**SAED** stands for Synopsys Armenia Educational Department, the university where I received my bachelor's degree. \
This project is course work that I have done during SAED's C++ course, from Feb/2022 to May/2022. The program has a section for registration and stores the personal information of each user.
Users can "log in" and "log out" of a custom system (for example, a sports complex or a bank), and the program saves this information and allows the user to view the history of their actions.

## üéÆ Controls

* Move up with keys:
&nbsp;&nbsp; <code><strong>arrow_up, w</strong></code>
* Move down with keys: 
&nbsp;&nbsp; <code><strong>arrow_down, s</strong></code>
* Select a section in the menu with the keys: 
&nbsp;&nbsp; <code><strong>arrow_right, d</strong></code>
* Quit from the current menu with the keys:
&nbsp;&nbsp; <code><strong>arrow_left, a, q</strong></code>

In the sign-up menu, after you input your personal information, press **`"enter"`** to confirm your input and move on. \
In the home‚ûúmy_profile‚ûúedit_profile menu, press **`"enter"`** in the section you want to change and input your new information. Be careful while solving CAPTCHA :))

## üë®‚Äçüíª Getting Started
1. Start by updating the packages list: &nbsp;`sudo apt update`
2. Install the G++ compiler if you don't have: &nbsp;`sudo apt install build-essential`
3. Check installation with the command: &nbsp;`g++ --version`
4. Make must be installed with the build-essential package; check it: &nbsp;`make --version`
5. Install the make package if you don't have: &nbsp;`sudo apt install make`
6. Clone this repo: &nbsp;`git clone https://github.com/dpetrosy/SAED_visitors_program.git`
7. Go to directory: &nbsp;`cd SAED_visitors_program`
8. Run the make and build program: &nbsp;`make`
9. Run executable: &nbsp;`./program.exe`
10. Congrats! Now you can test my program functionality :)

The second program, where you can "log in" and "log out" from system also compiles like this.
